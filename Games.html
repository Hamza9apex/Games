        In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought
        to be the first video game. It was a very simple tennis game, similar to
        the classic 1970s video game Pong.First created by Bjarne Stroustrup as
        an extension of the C programming language in 1982, C++ went on to make
        a name for itself in the years to come. C++ is the most popular language
        for creating game engines â€”the development environments where game
        programmers create and host their interactive worlds.
